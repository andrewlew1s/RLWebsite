			<p>Rachel joined PPL as an Analyst in October 2017 after completing a business management graduate scheme with Cambridge University Press.
During the scheme, she worked on an internal consultancy basis on a range of change projects in a not-for-profit context. Her projects were aimed at making better use of data, overcoming organisational siloes and improving legacy processes, with a particular focus on developing person-centred approaches and putting users and customers at the heart of business decisions. Her work included acting as programme manager for a company-wide change to encourage better customer focus and co-created solutions. She also worked on launching a revised governance process for the multi-million pound technology portfolio, and on creating data analyses
to inform process improvements in the technology, marketing and education departments.
Her interest in the public sector, the health service and the third sector was sparked by voluntary work in a community health centre as part of national citizenship service whilst still at school. She has since volunteered for educational charities in the UK and Nepal and also spent a year as editor-in-chief of a health and development publication at the University of Cambridge, editing and writing academic articles on health, sustainability and international development.
Rachel holds a BA in English Literature from the University of Cambridge, where she was a Peterhouse scholar.</p>
