					Rachel joined PPL as an Analyst in October 2017 after completing a business management graduate scheme with Cambridge University Press.
					During the scheme, she worked on an internal consultancy basis on a range of change projects in a not-for-profit context. Her projects were
					aimed at making better use of data, overcoming organisational siloes and improving legacy processes, with a particular focus on developing
					person-centred approaches and putting users and customers at the heart of business decisions. Her work included acting as programme manager
					for a company-wide change to encourage better customer focus and co-created solutions. She also worked on launching a revised governance
					process for the multi-million pound technology portfolio, and on creating data analyses to inform process improvements in the technology,

					Her interest in the public sector, the health service and the third sector was sparked by voluntary
					work in a community health centre as part of national citizenship service whilst still at school. She has since volunteered for educational
					charities in the UK and Nepal and also spent a year as editor-in-chief of a health and development publication at the University of
					Cambridge, editing and writing academic articles on health, sustainability and international development. Rachel holds a BA in English
					Literature from the University of Cambridge, where she was a Peterhouse scholar.
