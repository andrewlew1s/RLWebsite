					Most recently I worked on a collaborative performance with dancers and circus performers at the Roundhouse in Camden (2018) as a Young Producer with Poet in the City (2017). I previously studied English Literature at the University of Cambridge, where I led Chameleon, the university’s creative writing society and was a Poetry Editor for the Mays anthology.

					My poetry has been published by The Poetry Book Society, the Poetry Society, Kindling journal and many more. I have performed on canal towpaths, in cellars underneath feminist pubs, in many a student bar and on the Roundhouse main stage.
