					Hello! My name is Rachel, and welcome to my website! I am a 23-year-old award-winning poet and performer living and working in London. I make poetry happen through writing, performing, collaborating with other artists and coordinating poetry publications and events.

					Most recently I worked on a collaborative performance with dancers and circus performers at the Roundhouse in Camden (2018) as a Young Producer with Poet in the City (2017). I previously studied English Literature at the University of Cambridge, where I led Chameleon, the university’s creative writing society and was a Poetry Editor for the Mays anthology.
