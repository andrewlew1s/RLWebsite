Its roundness straining at thin skin.
She nicks with the serrated blade its edge,
And pauses, and slices her first incision.

The new halves split, peeling apart,
Their several hearts displaying
Great symmetry and difference,
With a pip more here and there.

Two hemipsheres. With every cut
Another and another and another,
Smaller, smaller, smaller, less to hold,
Less space to cut the next from.`,

		text: `In between hunts, when I lie in the grasses
And practise the stillness of death,
I have been thinking hard.
And I believe, Father, that what is gone is certitude.
We learnt the loss of you in between licks,
When we asked where our bull elephant,
Our antlered stag, our spring-spout was.
Mother said you were a wanderer, that all men are,
You were never going to be around for long.
I do my best without you. I rise
As I believe you rose, as I saw Mother
Surge, all dappled haunches, in the den.
Like her, only heavier. For I think you would stand
With all the thunder-strength of muscled cloud.
Now I am big as she said you were and I would be,
Eye-level with the lightning-riven tree.
But she was wrong as well, said you were wandering
Through forests longer than the sky is high,
Forests full of other fathers. I have looked for you.
I have walked the orange day and the black night.
But I could not even find the forests, could not
Even find the way to you. All I found was men
And the carcasses of lands they leave behind.
Father I am afraid for you, lost somewhere
I cannot help, somewhere I cannot even see.
But Father, I am still more afraid for me.`,

		text: `Old words sound beautiful
Because we donâ€™t know what they mean.

But then you unwrapped them onstage,
Blue cloths unwound from your arms.

Your conquerors they took your lips, your eyes,
Your gods, but then you held each other,

Not killed by guns and the boys they bear
But shattered beyond all signs of breaking.

O Helen, were your feet broken
From the ground, was your waist chained,
Were you raped with the dancing girls?

You buried your Astyanax
In a cardboard box. Time is collapsed.

There is no story but this story telling
Its retelling, Troy is always falling.`,
